# Edge Functions - COMPLETELY DISABLED

DevTrack Africa operates as a pure client-side React application with Supabase.

All edge functions have been completely removed to prevent deployment conflicts.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase (client-side SDK only)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage

No edge functions are needed or supported.
